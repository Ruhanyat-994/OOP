Define a class `Vehicle` with properties `brand` and `year` of manufacture. Derive two classes `Car` and `Motorcycle` from `Vehicle`. Each subclass should have an additional property (`numDoors` for `Car` and `hasSideCar` for `Motorcycle`). Implement a method `display()` in each class to print all relevant details.

### Problem 2: Geometry Inheritance

Create a superclass `Shape` with methods `calculateArea()` and `calculatePerimeter()`. Derive classes `Rectangle` and `Circle` from `Shape`. Implement methods in each subclass to compute area and perimeter specific to rectangles and circles.

### Problem 3: Employee Inheritance

Define a superclass `Employee` with properties `name` and `salary`. Derive classes `Manager` and `Worker` from `Employee`. `Manager` should have an additional property `department`, and `Worker` should have `hoursWorked`. Implement a method `calculateSalary()` in each subclass to calculate salary based on their specific rules (e.g., managers get bonuses, workers get overtime pay).

### Problem 4: Bank Account Inheritance

Create a superclass `BankAccount` with properties `accountNumber` and `balance`. Derive classes `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount` from `BankAccount`. `SavingsAccount` should have an interest rate property and methods for deposit and withdrawal. `CurrentAccount` should have an overdraft limit and methods to manage it.

### Problem 5: Animal Inheritance

Define a superclass `Animal` with properties `name` and `type` (e.g., mammal, reptile). Derive classes `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Snake` from `Animal`. Each subclass should have additional properties (`breed` for `Dog` and `Cat`, `isVenomous` for `Snake`). Implement methods in each subclass to display details including breed-specific information.

### Problem 6: School Inheritance

Create a superclass `Person` with properties `name` and `age`. Derive classes `Student` and `Teacher` from `Person`. Each subclass should have additional properties (`grade` for `Student`, `subject` for `Teacher`). Implement methods in each subclass to display details including grade-specific or subject-specific information.

### Problem 7: Shape Hierarchy

Define a superclass `Shape` with methods `draw()` and `erase()`. Derive classes `Rectangle`, `Circle`, and `Triangle` from `Shape`. Implement methods in each subclass to draw and erase shapes specific to rectangles, circles, and triangles.

### Problem 8: Media Player Inheritance

Create a superclass `MediaPlayer` with methods `play()`, `pause()`, and `stop()`. Derive classes `AudioPlayer` and `VideoPlayer` from `MediaPlayer`. Each subclass should have additional methods (`skip()` for `AudioPlayer`, `seek()` for `VideoPlayer`). Implement methods to perform these actions based on the media type.

### Problem 9: Vehicle Rental Inheritance

Define a superclass `Vehicle` with properties `make`, `model`, and `year`. Derive classes `Car` and `Truck` from `Vehicle`. Each subclass should have additional properties (`numDoors` for `Car`, `cargoCapacity` for `Truck`). Implement methods to display rental details including specific information for cars and trucks.

### Problem 10: Product Hierarchy

Create a superclass `Product` with properties `productId`, `productName`, and `price`. Derive classes `Book` and `Electronics` from `Product`. `Book` should have an additional property `author`, and `Electronics` should have `warrantyPeriod`. Implement methods to display details specific to books and electronics.
